* INSTRUCTIONS
This configuration is used with Emacs 25, but should still work with Emacs 24.

1. Use =M-x list-packages= to install [[https://github.com/edvorg/req-package][req-package]].
2. =mv ~/.emacs ~/.emacs-old=
3. =git clone https://github.com/edvorg/req-package.git ~/.emacs=
4. Load =~/.emacs/init.el= and =M-x eval-buffer=
  - This will download many packages and compile them
5. =M-x byte-compile-file= and select =~/.emacs/init.el=
6. Restart Emacs

* NOTE
You will want to change the font in custom.el if you do not have Inconsolata installed. I use Menlo on Mac OS X.
